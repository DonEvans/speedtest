# Ruby on Rails: Computer Speed Test

This app uses a javascript to test the speed of your computer's processor and Javascript engine. Rails 3.0.9 is used to store the results. The app is hosted on heroku at www.computer-speed-test.us

Using Javascript allows the test to conveniently be run on a wide variety of systems. 

It also includes several static pages comparing the speed of different languages and browsers. Older browsers are very much slower.
